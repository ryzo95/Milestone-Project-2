I'm sorry for any confusion, but I'm a text-based AI model, and I can't directly create websites or deploy them for you. However, I can provide you with a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript template to get you started on building the website yourself. Please note that this is a simplified example, and you'll need to adapt and expand upon it to create a fully functional site.

Here's a basic template:

index.html:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Holiday Destination Search</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Holiday Destination Search</h1>
        <input type="text" id="searchInput" placeholder="Enter a destination">
    </header>
    <div id="map"></div>

    <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=places"></script>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
